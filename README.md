# SeminarProject

## Abstract

This seminar explores the impact of information systems in the restaurant industry, particularly focusing on the use of food delivery apps, during the Corona crisis. The primary research question guiding our investigation is: "How did information systems in the field of restaurants affect the provision of service to customers during the Corona crisis?" The study aims to address this overarching question through four focused inquiries:

1. **Functional Capabilities of Food Delivery Applications:**
   - What are the main functional capabilities of food delivery applications in the field of restaurants that enabled an optimum customer experience during the Corona period?

2. **Type of Applications and Customer Satisfaction:**
   - Is there a relationship between the type of applications (internal or external service) for deliveries that the restaurant provided during the Corona period and customer satisfaction?

3. **Digital Transition and Order Volume:**
   - To what extent is there a relationship between the restaurant's transition to service by digital means and the amount of orders in the restaurant during closing periods and in between?

4. **Digital Service and Customer Retention:**
   - To what extent is there a connection between the restaurant's transition to digital service and the customer's continued use of food delivery apps during the Corona period and after the Corona period?

## Research Methods

The study employs two research methods:

1. **Survey/Questionnaire:**
   - 154 respondents participated in the survey.

2. **Database Analysis:**
   - Collected 1681 responses for in-depth analysis.

## Findings

The survey results, with a 95% level of significance, indicate a positive relationship between the restaurant's transition to digital service and:
- Customer satisfaction
- The number of orders placed by customers
- Repeated use of applications during and after the epidemic

One focused question in the database analysis, using a live squared test at a significance level of 95%, shows a positive relationship between the central functional capabilities of food delivery apps and the customer experience.

## Conclusions

The study confirms the four hypotheses derived from the focused questions. In the discussion and conclusions chapter, our recommendation for future studies is to conduct research after the end of the Corona epidemic and closures. This future study should explore the effects of information systems in the restaurant industry on customer service provision, delving into why people choose food delivery apps over physical restaurant dining. Additionally, it should investigate whether the number of customers physically visiting the restaurant surpasses those ordering through food delivery apps from restaurants.
